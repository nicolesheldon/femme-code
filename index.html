    <h3 class="wowtitle">Scarlett Curtis</h3>
    <p class="wowblurb">Scarlett Curtis, this week's WoW is a contributing editor and columnist of The Sunday Times Style Magazine. The list of major publications she has written for is expansive including The Guardian, GLAMOUR, Elle, InStyle, The
      Telegraph, Tatler and Vogue, but this is not all that is impressive about Curtis. In 2017, Scarlett founded The Pink Protest with Grace Campbell and Alice Skinner; The Pink Protest is dedicated to engaging in action and supporting the
      community of activists it fosters which grows each day. It has started up the Free Periods movement which aims to end period poverty in the UK as well as providing information about period poverty, and promoting donation forums supporting
      relevant charities and up-and-coming sustainable menstruation products. Curtis has just curated a book called Feminists Don't Wear Pink (and other lies) which is a collection of writing from an array of women, Adwoa Aboah, Dolly Alderton,
      Gemma Arteton and Bridget Jones (by Helen Fielding) to name a few. All of the royalties from the book will go to the UN movement Girl Up, an initiative of women dedicated to creating social change.
      This book is the reason why Scarlett Curtis is our WoW. After setting up a pop-up stall in Oxford Street's Topshop selling the book as well as other products, Curtis was asked to take a breather outside for a moment. When she returned the
      stall had been taken down, in all of twenty minutes. Since then it has been reported that Philip Green, Chairman of the Arcadia Group which contains Topshop and the recent subject of allegations fuelling the Me Too movement, having caught wind
      of the stall, had it taken down. Following this scandal, Curtis has spoken candidly about it and even got the #pinknotgreen trending. Showing strength in the face of adversity, Scarlett Curtis is an inspiration to us all and a role model we
      are proud to bring to light in any way we can.
